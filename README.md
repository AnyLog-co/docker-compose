# Deploying AnyLog 

The following provides information on how to deploy AnyLog using either as _docker-compose_ or _kubernetes_. 

### AnyLog Node Types
* master - A node that's dedicated to managing the ledger on the blockchain (database)
* operator - Node that contains the data generated by devices and sensors
* publisher - Node to distribute data coming in from different devices and sensors across the different operator nodes
* query - Node dedicated to query the data, usually connected to a BI tool, such as Grafana
* standalone - An AnyLog instance that consists of both _master_ and _operator_ processes 
* standalone-publisher - An AnyLog instance that consists of both _master_ and _publisher_ processes

**Note**: All nodes can query the data on the different operators, there's no requirement for a dedicated node in order
to query data. 


## Requirements  
* docker / docker-compose 
* kompose
* kubectl
* minikube 
* helm

## Directory Structure
**Docker Compose** 
* [docker-compose](docker-compose/docker_install.sh) - installation of docker & docker-compose
* [AnyLog Node](docker-compose/anylog-node) - docker-compose file to install AnyLog-Node & Postgres (v.14.0-alpine) instance 
* [AnyLog Tools](docker-compose/anylog-tools) - docker-compose file to install AnyLog-GUI and our Remote-CLI
* [Postgres](docker-compose/postgres.sh) - shell script to install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Grafana](docker-compose/grafana.sh) - shell script to [installing Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/) 
via docker

**Kubernetes Deployment**
* [install.sh](helm/install.sh) - script to install _kompose_, _kubectl_, _minikube_ and _helm_
* [credentials.sh](helm/credentials.sh) - configure credentials for Kubernetes in order to download AnyLog
