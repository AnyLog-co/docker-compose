#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Blockchain Layer Configuration
#
# The blockchain layer manages metadata either through a master node or the Optimism platform.
#
# When `BLOCKCHAIN_SOURCE` is set to a platform other than "master" (e.g., "optimism") and `NODE_TYPE` is "master",
# the node will function as a relay between the blockchain and other nodes.
#
# To use a real blockchain:
#   - Set `BLOCKCHAIN_SOURCE` to "optimism".
#   - By default, deployment scripts use AnyLogâ€™s test configurations for an Optimism-based blockchain.
#   - To use your own deployment, update the configurations in the "Real Blockchain" section.
#
# Steps to deploy using a real blockchain:
#   1. Deploy Node A with `BLOCKCHAIN_SOURCE` set to "optimism".
#   2. On Node A, retrieve the contract ID using the AnyLog command: `print !contract_id`.
#   3. Configure Node B with:
#      - `BLOCKCHAIN_SOURCE` set to "optimism"
#      - `CONTRACT` set to the contract ID obtained from Node A.
#   4. Deploy Node B.
#   5. Repeat the process for additional nodes.
#
# Relay-Based Deployment:
#   - Alternatively, users can configure only the master node to interface directly with the blockchain.
#   - Other nodes will sync metadata through the master, instead of communicating with the blockchain directly.
#   - This setup, called a "relay," reduces the need for all nodes to independently interact with the blockchain.
